Code for the ALA-AAMAS 2022 workshop paper "Building Multi-Agent Environments with Theoretical Guarantees on the Learning of Ethical Policies".

The files implement in Python3 our Multi-Agent Ethical Environment Designing Algorithm, a novel algorithm from our paper.

Required libraries:

* SciPy 1.4 or a higher version
* NumPy 1.14 or a higher version
* PyGame 2.0 or a higher version (only necessary for animated visualisation of the learnt policies)
